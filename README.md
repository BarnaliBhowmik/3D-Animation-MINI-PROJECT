# 3D Scrolling Animation with Canvas 🎨✨

Welcome to the **3D Scrolling Animation Project**! This project demonstrates how to create a stunning and interactive 3D animation using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The animation features a dynamic canvas showcasing a **Korean character** that moves and makes facial expressions as you scroll through the page.  

## 🚀 Features
- Smooth **scrolling animation** with engaging 3D effects.
- Dynamic movement, rotation, and facial expressions using **JavaScript**.
- **Canvas** element as the animation stage for advanced rendering.
- Integrated **CSS animations** for smooth transitions and enhanced visuals.
- Beginner-friendly and perfect for learning creative web animation techniques.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For setting up the canvas and animation structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling and smooth transition effects.
- **JavaScript**: To bring the animation to life with canvas manipulation.

## 📖 How It Works
1. **Canvas Setup**:  
   The animation runs on a canvas element, initialized with proper dimensions and styling. 

2. **Animation Logic**:  
   JavaScript controls the movement, rotation, and facial expressions of the character, synchronized with the user's scroll actions.

3. **3D Effect**:  
   Clever use of JavaScript and CSS to simulate 3D effects, providing depth and interactivity.
